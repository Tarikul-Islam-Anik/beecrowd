### What is [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en)?

Beecrowd, was known as URI Online Judge, is a platform that offers online programming challenges. It is used by programmers to hone their skills and by companies to screen candidates for programming jobs. It is a web application that allows users to create tasks and submit solutions. The solutions are then evaluated by the users and the tasks are re-assigned to the users who have the highest number of solutions.

### Solutions are available for the following languages:

### Why I'm sharing the solutions?

Actually, I've no unfair intention of sharing the solutions. Sometimes, people are not able to solve the problems that they want to solve. I think it can be helpful to see others' solutions when they are stuck and don't know how to begin.

### Did you solve all the problems in different languages by yourself?

Yes, I did.

### Can you share your solutions or optimize them?

Yes, you can! Just fork the repository and submit your work.

> **Note:** The solutions are not necessarily the best ones.

### Common Troubleshooting:

- **How read sample input in Javascript?**

  If you want to test your code on your local machine, you can follow this link: [Beecrowd Javascript Input](https://github.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/beecrowd-solutions/blob/master/JavaScript/!README.md).

  There I briefly explain how to the whole user input reading works and how you can
  achieve it in your local machine.

- **TIME LIMIT IN JAVA**

  If you keep receiving time limit in Java, make sure that your solution is using more optimized methods of input and output. As test cases can be large, if you use Scanner and System.out your solution will receive "Time Limit Exceeded". Only problems in the Beginner category will accept solutions with those methods.

- **I KEEP GETTING "WRONG ANSWER"! WHAT IS WRONG?**

  If you keep getting "Wrong Answer" and believe that your solution is correct, please check if your source code:

  - Is not printing nothing more than requested by the problem description, i.e. input messages, e.g. "Enter x:";

  - Is printing the last line of output followed by the end-of-line characted "\n";

- **WRONG ANSWER IN SIMPLE PROBLEM USING FLOATING-POINT**

  Try to use double instaed of float in C++. This is a common error due to the difference in precision between them.

- **NUMBER OF DIGITS AFTER THE DECIMAL POINT**
  - Using C++, this is one of the possible ways to format a number with 5 digits after the decimal point:
  ```C++
  #include <iomanip>
  ```
  - In the main (before printing the output, in any place), use:
  ```C++
  cout << fixed << setprecision(5);
  ```
