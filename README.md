### What is Beecrowd?

Beecrowd, was known as URI Online Judge, is a platform that offers online programming challenges. It is used by programmers to hone their skills and by companies to screen candidates for programming jobs. It is a web application that allows users to create tasks and submit solutions. The solutions are then evaluated by the users and the tasks are re-assigned to the users who have the highest number of solutions.

### Why I'm sharing the solutions?

Actually, I've no unfair intention of sharing the solutions. Sometimes, people are not able to solve the problems that they want to solve. I think it can be helpful to see others' solutions when they are stuck and don't know how to begin.

### Can you share your solutions or optimize them?

Yes, you can! Just fork the repository and submit your work.
